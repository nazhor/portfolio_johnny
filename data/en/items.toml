title = "No Wand Studios Corporate Identity "
description = "Graphic design and visual development I worked on while co-running No Wand Studios, our indie video game development studio based in Zaragoza, Spain. It was five years where I got to rebrand the company a couple of times. I also worked on adaptating the visual identity of the studio on special ocassions or releases. Through our logo and corporate identity I tried to convey the idea of effort and how hard it is to build up an studio. Hard work, fellowship and illusion were our funding principles and I always tried to let those ideas filter through my designs. As creative and art director, I was responsible for the whole thing: from laying out our brand identity to comunicate it through the graphic design and social media of the studio."

title = "Hello, My Name Is Nobody Game Development"
description = "Hello, My Name Is Nobody is a conversational game about those moments when you want to be alone surrounded by people. Doubts, desires and anxieties will flow through an innovative dialog system that features interruptions, changes of mind and more little mechanics, building the main core of the experience: organic and fluid conversations about everything and nothing. As creative, art and design director I was in charge of desiging the visual identity of the game and also the core gameplay mechanics of the game. As PR and marketing director, I also came up with the booth design we brought to EGX Rezzed 2018 where players could tag the wall creating an unique atmosphere for showing our game. Some of the influences ranged from Twin Peaks to Gorillaz. "

As creative director, I wanted this one to be as far as we could from the hyperrealistic techy scifi environments of The Fall of Lazarus, our first video game, so I took an urban-oniric approach in terms of narrative and visual design. I based the whole design on the idea of 'black light graffiti' walls because the game story is set in an undetermined place between life and death but I also wanted it to have an urban vibe."

Nowadays I'm a staff member of the team and I write reviews and essays both on the digital website and physical issues we release periodically. I try to talk about video games from a cultural perspective and how this medium can shape the world and influence it from its core mechanics, being as culturally relevant as cinema or literature. Sadly these pieces are in spanish, so if you want to read something from me you can check the The Fall of Lazarus Postmortem. Sorry!"

These are flawed and unfinished games from our early days as a team and game developers but it was fun working on them and we learnt a lot.

We realize we had improved a lot the graphic and visuals of the game so we thought we needed to update the trailer, and so I did. I really love editing and trying to make the clips work along the music we are using trying to put a rythm on it while telling a story or explaining the main mechanics of the game."
