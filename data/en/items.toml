title = "No Wand Studios Corporate Identity "
description = "Graphic design and visual development I worked on while co-running No Wand Studios, our indie video game development studio based in Zaragoza, Spain. Through our logo and corporate identity I tried to convey the idea of effort and how hard it is to build up an studio. Hard work, fellowship and illusion were our funding principles and I always tried to let those ideas filter through my designs. As creative and art director, I was responsible for the whole thing: from laying out our brand identity to comunicate it through the graphic design and social media of the studio."

description = "Back in 2012 I was studying my graphic design degree and Irreversible was my first attempt ever with video editing. I was responsible for the whole thing: original idea, storyboard, filming and editing. It had some technical challenges for a non-existent budget production like this one such as the travelling we wanted for the running section, so we had to improvise attaching the camera to my scooter and match the motorcycle speed with the actor run. This short film was originally made for the La Mirada Tabú national short film fest promoted by Sala López, a local indie pub."

As creative director, I wanted this one to be as far as we could from the hyperrealistic techy scifi environments of The Fall of Lazarus, our first video game, so I took an urban-oniric approach in terms of narrative and visual design. I based the whole design on the idea of 'black light graffiti' walls because the game story is set in an undetermined place between life and death but I also wanted it to have an urban vibe."

I was in charge of designing the gameplay and craft all graphic resources. Since it was a mobile game, I went with this whole papercraft aesthetic becase it was easier to anime once all assets were loaded in-engine and because a cartoon style fitted perfectly with the joyful game we wanted to make."
