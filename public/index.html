					<p class="header_text header_text_all" style="display: inline-block;"><strong>/johnny.JPG/ABOUT ME/ </strong>Hi! I&#39;m Jonathan Prat Guisado (aka .JPG), but everybody calls me Johnny. I&#39;m a graphic, narrative and game designer. But mostly I&#39;m a storyteller. I love telling stories and I do it through games, words and images. I studied graphic design and now I&#39;m focused on developing my game design skills. Some time ago I co-founded with my good friend David Bernad (and some former members) an indie video game development studio called No Wand Studios. For six years I was in charge of the creative and art direction of the studio and also I did game and narrative design. Finally I was responsible for the marketing and PR&amp;CM work too. We released some little jam games and The Fall of Lazarus, our first big project. Later on and when we were only the two of us (David and I) we closed the studio and started working hand in hand on Hello, My Name is Nobody, an experimental video game about conversations and loneliness that it is yet to be finished. I&#39;m also a staff editor at GameReport, a spanish video game focused editorial where we publish physical monographics and digital essays about video games analysing their uniqueness as a medium and their impact on society and culture. Here you&#39;ll find most of my work so far. Hope you like it as much as I love coffe and the Fast &amp; Furious films. &lt;3 </p>
					<p class="header_text header_text_img" style="display: none;"><strong>/johnny.png/GRAPHIC DESIGN AND ILLUSTRATION/ </strong>My graphic design works so far. A picture speaks a thousand words. Two thousand if it has a well-kerned font.</p>
					<p class="header_text header_text_vid" style="display: none;"><strong>/johnny.vid/VIDEO EDITING/ </strong>Some of my video edits. Mostly trailers, I love the challenge of having to be compelling while explaining something at the same time in just a couple of minutes.</p>
					<p class="header_text header_text_txt" style="display: none;"><strong>/johnny.txt/NARRATIVE DESIGN AND WRITING/ </strong>A selection of my writting pieces. Reviews, opinion columns, even a postmortem!</p>
					<p class="header_text header_text_vdg" style="display: none;"><strong>/johnny.exe/GAME DEVELOPMENT/ </strong>Video game developments I&#39;ve been involved as a game, narrative and graphic designer among many other roles like creative direction, PR&amp;CM or marketing. Interaction is such a powerful and unpredictable tool for immersing the audience into your story.</p>

It was five years where I got to rebrand the company a couple of times. I also worked on adaptating the visual identity of the studio on special ocassions or releases. Through our logo and corporate identity I tried to convey the idea of effort and how hard it is to build up an studio. Hard work, fellowship and illusion were our funding principles and I always tried to let those ideas filter through my designs. As creative and art director, I was responsible for the whole thing: from laying out our brand identity to comunicate it through the graphic design and social media of the studio." data-button_text="NWS Website" data-tag="image" data-video="" data-slide1="/images/images/img1_1.jpg" data-slide2="/images/images/img1_2.jpg" data-slide3="/images/images/img1_3.jpg" data-slide4="/images/images/img1_4.jpg" data-slide5="/images/images/img1_5.jpg" data-slide6="" data-slide7="" data-slide8="">

Doubts, desires and anxieties will flow through an innovative dialog system that features interruptions, changes of mind and more little mechanics, building the main core of the experience: organic and fluid conversations about everything and nothing. As creative, art and design director I was in charge of desiging the visual identity of the game and also the core gameplay mechanics of the game. As PR and marketing director, I also came up with the booth design we brought to EGX Rezzed 2018 where players could tag the wall creating an unique atmosphere for showing our game. We wanted to do a smaller game than our first one (The Fall of Lazarus) and we also wanted to go as far as we could from the hyperrealism, so I came up with this original idea of an oniric neon bar crowded by people wearing animal masks. Some of the influences ranged from Twin Peaks to Gorillaz.

We realize we had improved a lot the graphic and visuals of the game so we thought we needed to update the trailer, and so I did.
